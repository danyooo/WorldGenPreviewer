* View a list of upcoming generations (caves, underworld, etc..)
* Pause world generation (which allows for a few things..)
  * Repeat the previous step in world generation (i.e creating jungle)
  * Advance to the next step in world generation
* Remove parts that are generated (i.e floating islands, deserts, etc..)
* Skip to features that are generated
